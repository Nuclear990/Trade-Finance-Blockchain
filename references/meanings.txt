A TOKEN in blockchain is a digital asset built on an existing blockchain (such as Ethereum) that represents value, ownership, or access rights to a specific product or service. Unlike a coin (like Bitcoin or Ether), which has its own independent blockchain and functions as a native currency, a token leverages the underlying technology and smart contracts of an existing network. 

On-chain = inside the blockchain itself.

	Anything on-chain is:
		stored in smart contract storage
		executed by smart contracts
		validated by consensus
		immutable (can’t be edited)
		expensive / slow
		visible to all participants
		deterministic (no randomness, no external API calls)

	If you write a Solidity function, deploy it on Besu, and call it → that’s on-chain.
	
Off-chain = anything done outside the blockchain.

	This includes:
		SpringBoot backend
		database
		front-end UI
		API endpoints
		normal business logic
		logs
		calculations
		authentication
		user actions that don’t need blockchain security

	Off-chain is:
		faster
		cheaper
		flexible
		editable
		can connect to external systems
		can hide private data
