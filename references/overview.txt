Goal - A private blockchain prototype for handling international trade finance.

Actors - Bank, Company (importer/exporter), shipper

Documents - Letter of Credit, Bill of Lading

Business Flow - 
	
	Importer requests LC → your frontend form.

	Bank approves → backend calls LCToken.mint.

	Exporter ships goods.

	Shipper issues B/L → BLToken.mint.

	Exporter → ExporterBank → ImporterBank → (you simulate this with role-based buttons).

	ImporterBank calls validateBL() in TradeFinanceManager.

	Contract automatically triggers:

		Ether.transfer(ImporterBank → ExporterBank)

		Transfers ownership of B/L NFT to importer

	Importer gives B/L NFT to shipper → unlock goods.

Functionalities - 
	
	Bank 
		ON-CHAIN (smart contract) 
			issue LC 
			verify B/L against LC 
			release payment (token transfer) 
			transfer B/L to importer 
			receive B/L from exporter bank 
		OFF-CHAIN (backend) 
			maintain accounts 
			maintain balances logs/history UI 
	
	Company 
		ON-CHAIN 
			request LC 
			confirm receipt of B/L 
			acknowledge goods received 
			
			handover goods (trigger shipper action) 
			receive B/L from shipper 
			submit B/L to exporter bank 
		
		OFF-CHAIN 
			deposit money (your backend simulates wallet balance) 
			
			receive payment (backend updates “balance”) 
			
			view logs 
	
	Shipper 
		ON-CHAIN 
			issue B/L transfer B/L to exporter 
			release goods to importer 
		
		OFF-CHAIN 
			logs


Technology stack - 
	Blockchain - Hyperledger Besu with IBFT consensus
	Smart Contracts - Solidity	
	Frontend - HTML, CSS, JS, Ethers.js
	Backend - SpringBoot, Web3.js 
	Database - PostgreSQL
	API - REST API
	
Tokens - 
	B/L - NFT - ERC721
	LC - NFT - ERC721

Currency - Ether 
Goods - represented by a Struct
Identity - on-chain registry

Smart Contracts -

	A. IdentityRegistry - Stores who is importer/exporter/bank/shipper.

	B. LCToken (ERC721) - Stores LC info: applicant (importer), beneficiary (exporter), amount, conditions.
			      Only bank can mint.

	C. BLToken (ERC721) - Stores: shipper, exporter, importer, goods description, shipment status.
			      Only shipper can mint.

	D. TradeFinanceManager - Checks conditions like:
					If ImporterBank receives valid B/L → release payment
					If Importer gives B/L to Shipper → release goods
      				It calls Ether transfer functions for money flow.
      				
      				
Frontend - Dashboards - Company, Bank, Shipper

Database Tables - 
	1. users
		Holds company, bank officers, shipper staff.
		Your backend uses this for login/roles.

	2. accounts
		Simulated wallet balances off-chain.

	3. lc_records
		Local mirror of LC NFT metadata.

	4. bl_records
		Local mirror of B/L NFT metadata.

	5. goods_records
		Stores goods info (description, quantity, status).

	6. transactions_log
		Every on-chain + off-chain action for audit.


LC (Letter of Credit)
	States:
		REQUESTED (off-chain only)
		ISSUED (NFT minted)
		UTILIZED (BL validated, payment released)
		CLOSED
Who can move state?
Bank only.

BL (Bill of Lading)
	States:
		ISSUED
		SUBMITTED_TO_BANK
		ACCEPTED
		TRANSFERRED_TO_IMPORTER
		SURRENDERED_TO_SHIPPER
Who controls transitions?
Shipper → Exporter → Banks → Importer → Shipper

Goods
	States:
		CREATED
		IN_TRANSIT
		RELEASED
Goods never move money. They only gate actions.
