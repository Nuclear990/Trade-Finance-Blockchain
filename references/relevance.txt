We’re building a regulator-aligned trade finance network that gives banks a single, immutable view of trade transactions instead of fragmented bilateral systems.
It allows multiple banks to jointly guarantee a trade, so no single bank has to carry the entire risk.
For companies, this means faster access to larger guarantees without being limited by one bank’s balance sheet.
Central authorities participate as audit nodes, which gives them real-time visibility rather than after-the-fact reporting.
The whole system runs on a permissioned, Ethereum-compatible ledger with immediate finality and no public blockchain costs.

We monetize as a consortium infrastructure operator, charging banks and institutions for access, governance, and regulated operation—not per transaction and not through tokens.

We run a regulator-aligned trade finance network where multiple banks can jointly guarantee trades on an immutable ledger, giving companies better access to capital and regulators real-time oversight—without public blockchain risk.
